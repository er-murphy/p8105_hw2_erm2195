# Problem 1

Goal: merging the FiveThirtyEight `pols-month.csv`, `unemployment.csv`,
and `snp.csv` data into a single data frame using year and month as keys
across datasets.

## Loading Libraries

First, loading the `tidyverse` and `readxl` libraries for use throughout
the homework.

``` r
library(tidyverse)
```

    ## ── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──
    ## ✔ dplyr     1.1.3     ✔ readr     2.1.4
    ## ✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.0
    ## ✔ ggplot2   3.4.3     ✔ tibble    3.2.1
    ## ✔ lubridate 1.9.2     ✔ tidyr     1.3.0
    ## ✔ purrr     1.0.2     
    ## ── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──
    ## ✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()
    ## ✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()
    ## ℹ Use the conflicted package (<http://conflicted.r-lib.org/>) to force all conflicts to become errors

``` r
library(readxl)
```

## Cleaning `pols-month` Data

Now, cleaning the data in `pols-month.csv`:

- Using separate() to break up the variable `mon` into integer variables
  `year`, `month`, and `day`
- Replacing month number with month name
- Creating a `president` variable taking values “gop” and “dem”
- Removing `prez_dem` and `prez_gop` variables
- Removing the `day` variable

``` r
pols = 
  read_csv("Data/pols-month.csv") |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  separate(mon, into = c("year", "month", "day"), sep = "-") |> 
  mutate(
    year = as.integer(year),
    month = as.integer(month),
    day = as.integer(day),
    president = ifelse(prez_dem > 0 , "dem", "gop"),
    month = case_match(month,
      1 ~ "January",
      2 ~ "February",
      3 ~ "March",
      4 ~ "April",
      5 ~ "May",
      6 ~ "June",
      7 ~ "July",
      8 ~ "August",
      9 ~ "September",
      10 ~ "October",
      11 ~ "November",
      12 ~ "December")
  ) |> 
  select(-starts_with("prez"), -day)
```

    ## Rows: 822 Columns: 9
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## dbl  (8): prez_gop, gov_gop, sen_gop, rep_gop, prez_dem, gov_dem, sen_dem, r...
    ## date (1): mon
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

## Cleaning `snp` Data

Second, cleaning the data in `snp.csv` using a similar process:

- Using separate() to break up the variable `date` into integer
  variables `year`, `month`, and `day`
- Converting the `year` variable into a 4 digit value
- Replacing month number with month name
- Reorganizing so that year and month are the leading columns
- Removing the `day` variable

``` r
snp = 
  read_csv("Data/snp.csv") |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  separate(date, into = c("month", "day", "year"), sep = "/") |> 
  mutate(
    year = as.integer(year),
    month = as.integer(month),
    day = as.integer(day),
    year = ifelse(as.integer(year) < 24, as.integer(year) + 2000, as.integer(year) + 1900),
    month = case_match(month,
      1 ~ "January",
      2 ~ "February",
      3 ~ "March",
      4 ~ "April",
      5 ~ "May",
      6 ~ "June",
      7 ~ "July",
      8 ~ "August",
      9 ~ "September",
      10 ~ "October",
      11 ~ "November",
      12 ~ "December")
  ) |> 
  select(year, month, close)
```

    ## Rows: 787 Columns: 2
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr (1): date
    ## dbl (1): close
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

## Cleaning `unemployment` Data

Third, tidying the data in `unemployment.csv` so that it can be merged
with the other two datasets:

- Switch from “wide” to “long” format - turn months into a single
  column, and the value of existing `months` column into a column called
  `unemployment`
- Converting month names to capitalized full names to match the format
  of other datasets

``` r
unemployment = 
  read_csv("Data/unemployment.csv") |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  pivot_longer(jan:dec, names_to = "month", values_to = "unemployment") |> 
  mutate(
    month = case_match(month,
    "jan" ~ "January",
    "feb" ~ "February",
    "mar" ~ "March",
    "apr" ~ "April",
    "may" ~ "May",
    "jun" ~ "June",
    "jul" ~ "July",
    "aug" ~ "August",
    "sep" ~ "September",
    "oct" ~ "October",
    "nov" ~ "November",
    "dec" ~ "December")
  )
```

    ## Rows: 68 Columns: 13
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## dbl (13): Year, Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

## Merging the Data Sets

Joining the datasets by merging `snp` into `pols`, and then merging
`unemployment` into the result. The resulting dataset is called
`data_538`

``` r
data_538 = left_join(pols, snp) |> 
  left_join(x = _, y = unemployment)
```

    ## Joining with `by = join_by(year, month)`
    ## Joining with `by = join_by(year, month)`

``` r
str(data_538)
```

    ## tibble [822 × 11] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)
    ##  $ year        : num [1:822] 1947 1947 1947 1947 1947 ...
    ##  $ month       : chr [1:822] "January" "February" "March" "April" ...
    ##  $ gov_gop     : num [1:822] 23 23 23 23 23 23 23 23 23 23 ...
    ##  $ sen_gop     : num [1:822] 51 51 51 51 51 51 51 51 51 51 ...
    ##  $ rep_gop     : num [1:822] 253 253 253 253 253 253 253 253 253 253 ...
    ##  $ gov_dem     : num [1:822] 23 23 23 23 23 23 23 23 23 23 ...
    ##  $ sen_dem     : num [1:822] 45 45 45 45 45 45 45 45 45 45 ...
    ##  $ rep_dem     : num [1:822] 198 198 198 198 198 198 198 198 198 198 ...
    ##  $ president   : chr [1:822] "dem" "dem" "dem" "dem" ...
    ##  $ close       : num [1:822] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA ...
    ##  $ unemployment: num [1:822] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA ...

## Description of the Combined Data Set

The `pols` data set has 822 observations and 9 variables. It details the
party affiliation distribution (democrat or republican) for governors
and senators in a given year from 1947 to 2015. It also specifies the
political party of the president at that time. The `snp` data has 787
observations and 3 variables, and contains the closing value of the S&P
index on the associated date. The included dates range from 1950 to
2015. The `unemployment` data has 816 observations and 3 variables, and
contains the percentage of unemployment on the associated date, ranging
from years 1948 to 2015.

From the merged `538_data` data set we can see that in January from 1975
onward, in years with a democratic president, the average unemployment
rate was 6.57. For comparison, the average unemployment rate over the
same time period in which a republican was president was 6.47.

# Problem 2

## Cleaning `Mr. Trash Wheel` Data

First, reading in and cleaning the data from the Excel file sheet
`Mr. Trash Wheel`:

- Specifying the sheet in the Excel file
- Using arguments in `read_excel`, omitting non-data entries like rows
  with figures and columns containing notes. For the 2023 Mr. Trash
  Data, this is the first row and the `Homes` column
- Specifying reasonable variable names \> I think that the names
  imported from the Excel document are already pretty reasonable. For
  the sake of brevity, dropping the units from weight and volume (as I
  would just document these units elsewhere, rather than in the variable
  name itself)
- Omitting rows that don’t include dumpster-specific data \> removing
  the last row, which is a sum count of column values
- Creating a `homes_powered` for the approximate number of homes
  powered, based on the calculation described in the Homes powered note

``` r
mister = 
  read_excel("Data/202309 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel", range = cell_cols("A:M"), skip = 1, col_names = TRUE) |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  drop_na(dumpster) |> 
  rename(weight = weight_tons, volume = volume_cubic_yards) |>
  mutate(
    homes_powered = (weight * 500) / 30
  )
```

## Cleaning `Professor Trash Wheel` Data

Next, similarly reading in and cleaning the data from the Excel file
sheet `Professor Trash Wheel`:

- Specifying the sheet in the Excel file
- Using arguments in `read_excel`, omitting non-data entries like rows
  with figures and columns containing notes \*\* As with the Mr. Trash
  Data, this is the first row and the `Homes` column
- Specifying reasonable variable names \*\* I think that the names
  imported from the Excel document are already pretty reasonable. For
  the sake of brevity, dropping the units from weight and volume (as I
  would just document these units elsewhere, rather than in the variable
  name itself)
- Omitting rows that don’t include dumpster-specific data \> removing
  the last row, which is a sum count of column values
- Creating a `homes_powered` for the approximate number of homes
  powered, based on the calculation described in the Homes powered note

``` r
professor = 
  read_excel("Data/202309 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", sheet = "Professor Trash Wheel", range = cell_cols("A:M"), skip = 1, col_names = TRUE) |>
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  drop_na(dumpster) |> 
  rename(weight = weight_tons, volume = volume_cubic_yards) |> 
  mutate(
    homes_powered = (weight * 500) / 30
  )
```

## Cleaning `Gwynnda Trash Wheel` Data

Next, similarly reading in and cleaning the data from the Excel file
sheet `Gwynnda Trash Wheel`:

- Specifying the sheet in the Excel file
- Using arguments in `read_excel`, omitting non-data entries like rows
  with figures and columns containing notes \*\* As with the Mr. Trash
  Data, this is the first row and the `Homes` column
- Specifying reasonable variable names \*\* I think that the names
  imported from the Excel document are already pretty reasonable. For
  the sake of brevity, dropping the units from weight and volume (as I
  would just document these units elsewhere, rather than in the variable
  name itself)
- Omitting rows that don’t include dumpster-specific data
- Create a `homes_powered` for the approximate number of homes powered,
  based on the calculation described in the Homes powered note

``` r
gwynnda = 
  read_excel("Data/202309 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", sheet = "Gwynnda Trash Wheel", range = "A2:K158", col_names = TRUE) |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  rename(weight = weight_tons, volume = volume_cubic_yards) |> 
  drop_na(dumpster) |> 
  mutate(
    homes_powered = (weight * 500) / 30
  )
```

Then cleaning the `trash` data:

- Specifying reasonable variable names
- Omitting rows that don’t include dumpster-specific data
- Create a `homes_powered` for the approximate number of homes powered,
  based on the calculation described in the Homes powered note

## Merging the Data Sets

Add a column identifying the relevant dataset

Combine the Professor Trash Wheel and Gwynnda data sets with the
Mr. Trash Wheel dataset to produce a single dataset.

Joining the datasets by merging `snp` into `pols`, and then merging
`unemployment` into the result. The resulting dataset is called
`data_538`

Use a similar process to import, clean, and organize the data for
Professor Trash Wheel and Gwynnda, and combine these with the Mr. Trash
Wheel dataset to produce a single tidy dataset. To keep track of which
Trash Wheel is which, you may need to add an additional variable to all
datasets before combining.

Write a paragraph about these data; you are encouraged to use inline R.
Be sure to note the number of observations in the resulting dataset, and
give examples of key variables. For available data, what was the total
weight of trash collected by Professor Trash Wheel? What was the total
number of cigarette butts collected by Gwynnda in July of 2021?

# Questions

Questions to return to if have time before homework submission:

- More flexible way to skip the first row, last row, and right-most
  column when importing the Mr. Trash Wheel data?
